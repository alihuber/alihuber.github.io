Congratulations, you have reached the personal blog of Alexander Huber, software engineer, occasional musician, overall tinkerer.  

Here I write about things I created, that interest me, that bug me, that I want to save for later reference or other random stuff I just have to get off my mind.  
Over time, these main topics emerged from my ramblings:

* Programming and software, with a focus on web development
* General IT-related observations, tips, rants and experiments
* My personal life, the process of learning itself and everything in between

When I started blogging in 2010 I had no idea where it would lead me, so I just started writing in English and German at a whim.

I\'m currently living in Leipzig, but originate from around Stuttgart, Germany.
